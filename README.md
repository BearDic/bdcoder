# bdcoder
Simple CLI-like GUI for ffmpeg, for 60fps videos recorded by NVIDIA Shadowplay. Most for personal use.

## usage
It's on windows. You should compile bdcoder.cpp and put ffmpeg.exe into 'bin/' then it works. Just drag video files onto those batch files then it will execute. More instructions may be needed if you are using video scissor, just type as prompt says.
